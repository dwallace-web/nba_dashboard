#NBA Dashboard

This project was built on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project uses a nodejs/express proxy server to fetch data from  [The Sports DB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/).
React Router Dom drivres the navigation for this project. 
No CSS framework was used to build this website out. This is my most significant front end build without a ton of upfront, planning. 
Date / Time Formating is supported by [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).


This readme may not be updated. Ask me if any new features are added.
